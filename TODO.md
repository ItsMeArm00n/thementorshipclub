4. **Extract and move JS from previouswork.html**: Extract the inline JavaScript from previouswork.html and create scripts/previouswork.js, then update previouswork.html to link to the external JS file. ✅
5. **Organize assets into subfolders**: Created assets/mentors/, assets/icons/, assets/images/ and moved files accordingly. ✅
6. **Update image links in index.html**: Replace old image paths with new subfolder paths in index.html. ✅
7. **Update image links in announcement.html**: Replace old image paths with new subfolder paths in announcement.html. ✅

## Notes
- The 'styles' folder already existed and contains the CSS files.
- All inline JavaScript has been extracted to separate JS files in the 'scripts' folder.
- Assets have been organized into logical subfolders for better maintainability.
- All image links in HTML files have been updated to reflect the new paths.
- The website should now have a cleaner, more organized structure.
