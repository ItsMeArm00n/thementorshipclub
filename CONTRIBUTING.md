# ðŸ’« Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for stopping by and showing interest in contributing!  
Whether itâ€™s fixing a bug, improving design, or adding a new feature .... every contribution counts. ðŸ’™

## tHE How's 
- Pick an existing issue or suggest a new one and provide an approach if you are the one who is creating it
- Make your changes in a separate branch .. not directly on main.  
- Keep things simple, readable, and consistent with the current style.  
- Write short, clear commit messages that explain what you did.  
- Open a pull request (PR) once you're done and describe your changes briefly.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Before You Raise a PR
- Make sure everything works smoothly.
- Provide a clear description of what your PR changes.
- Include before/after screenshots for visual changes or a demo video or a deployed link
- Be open to feedback and improvements.
